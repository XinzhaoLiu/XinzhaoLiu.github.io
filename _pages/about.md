Hi, my name is Xinzhao Liu. I'm currently a Phd student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. [Deliang Wang](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/). I received my master degree from University of Rochester and bachelor degree from Dalian University of Technolofy. I'm broadly interested in speech enhancement, auditory perception and machine learning.
